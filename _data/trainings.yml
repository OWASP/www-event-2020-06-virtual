  Title: "Attacking and Defending Containers and Kubernetes"
  URL: /register/?id=sku_HOtd9tZbZM8NWp
  SectionId: sku_HOtd9tZbZM8NWp
  Description: "Organizations are rapidly moving towards microservice style architectures for their applications which 
    has led to container technology being implemented and taking over at a rapid rate.<br>
    Leading container technologies like Docker have risen in popularity and have been widely used because they have 
    helped package and deploy consistent-state applications across multiple environments. Container orchestration 
    technologies like Kubernetes help these deployments massively scale which can potentially increase the overall 
    attack-surface to a massive extent, if security is not given the attention required.<br>
    Security continues to remain a key challenge that both Organizations and security practitioners face with 
    containerized deployments.While containers continue to be vulnerable to security threats that plague any typical 
    application deployment, they also face specific security threats related to the containerization daemon, the shared 
    kernel and other shared resources like network, process and the filesystem. Serverless deployments face risks such as 
    insecure deployment configurations, inadequate monitoring and logging of functions, broken authentication, function 
    event data injection, insecure secret storage, and many more.<br>
    Attacking applications leveraging containers requires specific skill set and a deep understanding of their underlying 
    architecture.<br>
    This training is a practical approach with both Offensive and Defensive flavours making it ideal for security engineers, 
    red-teammers, devops engineers and developers with a plethora of hands-on exercises that have been designed from 
    real-world attacks and the security-specific challenges that we faced while implementing these technologies, helping 
    them test and implement security in a scalable manner.<br>
    The training consists of, but not limited to the following focus areas in Container and Kubernetes Security:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Introduction to Container Technology</li>
    <li>Containerized Deployments and Container Orchestration Technologies</li>
    <li>Container Threat-Model</li>
    <li>Attacking Containers and Security deep-dive</li>
    <li>Introduction to Kubernetes</li>
    <li>Threat-Model of Orchestration technologies</li>
    <li>Attacking Kubernetes</li>
    <li>Kubernetes Defense-in-Depth</li>
    <li>Logging & Monitoring Orchestrated deployments</li>

  Description: "Developers often do not know what the common issues are with the framework they are using. At the same time, 
    most common frameworks ship with easy ways to shoot your application’s security in the foot. In this world we live in, developer 
    education will fail if even one mistake is made, which will expose a dangerous vulnerability. In this talk, we’ll show how you 
    can dramatically reduce the chance developers will shoot themselves in the foot by giving them safer versions of their common 
    tools so your company can ship more secure code.<br>
    We will write wrapper classes and safe versions of common tools to eliminate XSS vectors, open redirects, XXE, SSRF, LFI, and 
    other dangerous bugs in your codebase. After that we’ll show simple steps to educate developers and gain traction in your 
    organization. Then we’ll show how easy it is to integrate SAST tools in your CI/CD pipeline to ensure your developers use your 
    safe tools rather than the footguns built into common frameworks.<br>
