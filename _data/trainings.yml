    opportunities to threat actors. This course will teach you how to review modern desktop
    apps, showcasing Node.js and Electron but using techniques that will also work against
    any other desktop app platform. Ideal for Penetration Testers, Desktop app Developers
    as well as everybody interested in JavaScript/Node.js/Electron app security.<br>
    All action, no fluff, improve your security analysis workflow and immediately apply these
    gained skills in your workplace, packed with exercises, extra mile challenges and CTF,
    self-paced and suitable for all skill levels, with continued education via unlimited email

  Description: "This session offers participants an interactive introduction to Threat Modeling, based on the 
    instructor's learning and experience over the past several years. A primary focus of this course is the 
    introduction of threat modeling activities into your organization's software development processes, to 
    improve the overall quality and security of the applications you build.<br>
    As a recent 'convert' to the application security world, your instructor has developed his 'expertise' 
    in threat modeling by gathering information from a variety of sources. He's combined those learnings with his 
    own experience to create a practical threat modeing approach he has successfully applied within his 
    professional roles.<br>
    In addition to addressing key questions around the 'Five Ws', the presentation will cover the 
    'Four Questions' approach to developing a model, and include several interactive exercises to provide direct 
    experience. A brief review of available modeing tools will also be included, along with a discussion of the

    Then this workshop is a good opportunity to get to know how it works by making your hands dirty in code 
    using Spring Security.<br>
    After an introduction to the basic concepts of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, we will use a boot-based 
    Spring sample application to gradually implement authentication and authorization using these standards.<br>
    <strong>Learning Objectives:</strong>
    <ul>
    <li>Differences between OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC)</li>
    <li>What is an Authorization Grant and when do I use which grant</li>
    <li>The detailed procedure of the Authorization Code Grant protocol flow</li>
    <li>Implementation of an OAuth 2.0/OIDC compliant Resource Server</li>
    <li>Differences between JWT and reference tokens</li>
    <li>Authorization by means of claims in JWT</li>

  Title: "Attacking and Defending Containers and Kubernetes"
  URL: /register/?id=sku_HOtd9tZbZM8NWp
  SectionId: sku_HOtd9tZbZM8NWp
  Description: "Organizations are rapidly moving towards microservice style architectures for their applications which 
    has led to container technology being implemented and taking over at a rapid rate.<br>
    Leading container technologies like Docker have risen in popularity and have been widely used because they have 
    helped package and deploy consistent-state applications across multiple environments. Container orchestration 
    technologies like Kubernetes help these deployments massively scale which can potentially increase the overall 
    attack-surface to a massive extent, if security is not given the attention required.<br>
    Security continues to remain a key challenge that both Organizations and security practitioners face with 
    containerized deployments.While containers continue to be vulnerable to security threats that plague any typical 
    application deployment, they also face specific security threats related to the containerization daemon, the shared 
    kernel and other shared resources like network, process and the filesystem. Serverless deployments face risks such as 
    insecure deployment configurations, inadequate monitoring and logging of functions, broken authentication, function 
    event data injection, insecure secret storage, and many more.<br>
    Attacking applications leveraging containers requires specific skill set and a deep understanding of their underlying 
    architecture.<br>
    This training is a practical approach with both Offensive and Defensive flavours making it ideal for security engineers, 
    red-teammers, devops engineers and developers with a plethora of hands-on exercises that have been designed from 
    real-world attacks and the security-specific challenges that we faced while implementing these technologies, helping 
    them test and implement security in a scalable manner.<br>
    The training consists of, but not limited to the following focus areas in Container and Kubernetes Security:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Introduction to Container Technology</li>
    <li>Containerized Deployments and Container Orchestration Technologies</li>
    <li>Container Threat-Model</li>
    <li>Attacking Containers and Security deep-dive</li>
    <li>Introduction to Kubernetes</li>
    <li>Threat-Model of Orchestration technologies</li>
    <li>Attacking Kubernetes</li>
    <li>Kubernetes Defense-in-Depth</li>
    <li>Logging & Monitoring Orchestrated deployments</li>

    an Architect, Developer, Pentester, Security or DevOps Engineer, or anyone with a need to understand and manage vulnerabilities in a Cloud 
    environment, understanding relevant hacking techniques is critical. This course covers both the theory as well as a number of modern techniques 
    that may be used to compromise various Cloud services and infrastructure. Prior pentest/security experience is not a strict requirement, 
    however, some knowledge of Cloud Services and familiarity with common Unix command-line syntax will be beneficial."
